### Frontier Research

1.  **Tsinghua's joint team** has cooked up something pretty amazing: a bio-inspired tactile sensor. This gem, called [SuperTac (AI News)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44460-025-00006-y), actually drew its inspiration from pigeon eyeballs! 💡 It features multi-spectral imaging that covers an ultra-wide range from ultraviolet to mid-infrared. Plus, it's got an accompanying **8.5B-parameter** tactile language model, DOVE. This breakthrough landed right on the 🔥 cover of the very first issue of 'Nature Sensors,' marking the first time a domestic institution has been the primary author. Talk about a win! ✨

2.  **SceneMaker framework** is here to conquer those tricky 3D scene generation problems! 🔥 IDEA Research, partnering with HKUST, has launched [SceneMaker (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10957), a tool that can generate full 3D scenes from any image. 🚀 It totally solves the geometric degradation issue when things are heavily occluded, which is a big deal! ✨ What's more, you can even control de-occlusion with **text commands**. The code and data? Already open-source on [GitHub Open Source (AI News)](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/SceneMaker). This bad boy can handle both indoor and outdoor synthetic images like a boss! 💪

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **A 17-year-old high school student**, Enrique, just rocked the math world! 🎒 During a break, he used AI to help solve Erdős Problem #347, even [earning a shout-out from Terence Tao (AI News)](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2026-01-25-4). He pulled it off using GPT Codex and Aristotle for **Lean formal verification**. Google's own Jeff Dean even retweeted and gave him props! ✨ The Erdős Problems website has officially marked the problem as "**definitely solved**." Seriously, folks, the era of deep integration between human creativity and 🔥 AI computing power has officially arrived!

2.  **AI programming** is sparking a hot debate among developers, with pros and cons flying everywhere! Some are standing firm, [refusing to use AI for coding (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46743095) to keep professional standards high. On the flip side, others are championing AI as an incredible tool to massively boost productivity. 💡 There's a real worry that junior developers might overdo it, cranking out **code that's a nightmare to maintain**. And let's not forget the LLM training data closed loop 🔄, which could totally create an echo chamber. Honestly, the community is getting pretty fed up with these super polarized AI discussions. 😩<br/>

### Top Open Source Projects

### Social Media Shares

1.  **Remotion Skills** is getting some serious flak for its crummy performance. One blogger [reported after actual testing (AI News)](https://x.com/oran_ge/status/2015384959188607317) that the layout was just... 💩 a hot mess. Turns out, not everything that gets hyped up is actually good! We're seeing more and more 'AI photo fakes' these days. So, my advice? Go try it out yourself before you make up your mind. 🤔 What you see isn't always what you get, ya know?

2.  **Clawdbot's security risks** are totally igniting a hot discussion! A blogger [warns (AI News)](https://x.com/op7418/status/2015316726511284627) all you newbie users to be super careful with installation. ⚠️ Linking your social accounts? That could totally get you banned. And the documentation? It's scarily high-threshold. 😩 Like, seriously, who'd let it control their main apps? 💀 Recommenders, you gotta add those security warnings! <br/>![AI News: Clawdbot App Security Risk Warning Screenshot](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/01/news_01kftyp62jfq1ba2zgae6e8qdc.avif)<br/>

3.  **Clawdbot project architecture** is definitely something developers should pay attention to! Peter Steinberger's [personal assistant project (AI News)](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/2015380647205036131) supports all the major communication platforms. If you're hyped about Agent architecture 🔧 and Sandbox implementations, this one's a must-see! The [Open Source Code (AI News)](https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot) is already out there. But for regular users, we'd probably suggest holding off for now. 😩 The stability of AI Agents? Still needs some serious watching. 💀<br/>![AI News: Clawdbot Project Feature Introduction Interface](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/01/news_01kftyphdae0arj87n8pdhejw6.avif)<br/>
