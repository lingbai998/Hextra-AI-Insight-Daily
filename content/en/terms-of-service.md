# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (the "Site" or "we")! Before you dive into our services, please give these Terms of Service a good read. By accessing or using the Site, you're pretty much saying "Yep, I agree!" to everything here.

## 1. Service Introduction
**The Site** offers a range of paid subscription content and membership services. This includes, but isn't limited to, awesome blog posts, exclusive resources, cool e-books, and vibrant community interactions. Just a heads-up: some of these goodies are exclusively for our subscribed users.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- **Users** need a valid email address and a password to set up their account.
- **Users** are on the hook for their account's security and all activities happening under it. Big no-no: don't transfer or share your account!
- **The Site** reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** an account if a user breaches these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Subscription services** are billed monthly or annually, with all costs clearly laid out on the checkout page. No hidden surprises!
- **All payments** are handled securely via third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. Rest assured, **the Site** doesn't store any of your payment info. We're not into that.
- **Subscriptions** will **automatically renew**, so keep that in mind! Make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle ends if you don't want to keep the good times rolling.
- **Our 14-day Refund Policy** is pretty sweet! If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service, you've got 14 days from your purchase date to snag a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email at the end of these Terms and tell us why you're not feeling it. Heads up: this is a one-time deal per user. After 14 days, or if you're not a first-timer, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law says otherwise.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- **All original content** on this Site is **copyrighted by us (hubtoday)**. Please, no copying, reproducing, or using it for commercial purposes without getting our green light first. Seriously, don't.
- **Users** get **non-exclusive, non-transferable access rights** to our content, strictly for personal learning and reading. It's like borrowing a cool book, not owning the library!
- If you're eyeing **our content** for commercial use or want to quote us extensively, just reach out to the Site for authorization. We're usually pretty friendly!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **It's a big no-no** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Let's keep things chill and respectful.
- **Also forbidden:** using technical tricks to mass download, scrape, or crack our exclusive member content. That's just not cool. 🙅‍♀️
- **The Site** totally has the right to ditch any inappropriate content and **ban users** who don't play by the rules. Consider this your fair warning.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We** reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services anytime, without prior notice. Think of it like a nimble startup – always evolving! ✨
- **The Site** won't be on the hook for any compensation if our content becomes temporarily unavailable due to things beyond our control, like acts of God (force majeure), server hiccups, or third-party service snafus. We do our best, but sometimes stuff happens!

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The info provided on this Site** is purely for reference. Seriously, it **doesn't count** as professional advice – we're not your financial advisor, lawyer, or doctor! 🧑‍💻👩‍⚖️🩺
- **The Site** is absolutely **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might face from using our content or services. Use it wisely, folks!

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are governed by, and interpreted according to, the laws of the State of California, USA 🇺🇸, totally ignoring any conflict of law principles. California dreamin', legal style!
- **Any beefs or disputes** arising from or related to these terms? Let's try to hash them out amicably first. If we can't play nice, you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. So, you know, legal road trip! 🗺️
