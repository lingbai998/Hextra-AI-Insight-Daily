# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (you can call us "the Site" or "we"). Before you dive into all our cool stuff, please give these Terms of Service a good read. By hopping on our site or using any of our services, you're pretty much saying "I agree!" and accepting these terms. Get it? 😉

## 1. Quick Peek at Our Services
So, what's the deal? Our Site hooks you up with paid subscription content and awesome member services. Think blog posts, exclusive goodies, e-books, and cool community chats. 😎 Just a heads-up: some of this stellar content is only for our subscribed users!

## 2. Your Account & Signing Up
- To snag an account, you'll need a valid email address and a snappy password. Easy peasy!
- You're totally responsible for keeping your account secure and for everything that happens under your login. Seriously, **no sharing or transferring your account** – that's a big no-no! 🙅‍♀️
- Heads up: if you break any of these rules, we might have to **pause or even close** your account. Just sayin'.

## 3. All About Paid Subscriptions
- Our subscriptions run monthly or annually, and you'll see all the costs super clear on the checkout page. No hidden fees!
- All your payments go through secure third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. We don't touch or store your payment info, so you're safe there. 👍
- Your subscription will **auto-renew** like clockwork unless you hit that cancel button before your current cycle ends. Don't forget!
- **Our Sweet 14-day Refund Policy**: If you're a first-timer and not totally stoked with our service within 14 days of buying it, you can totally get a full refund. Just ping us at the email address listed below and tell us why you're bouncing. Oh, and this offer is a one-time deal per user! After 14 days, or if you're not a first-time subscriber, then sorry, folks – **no refunds** after payment, unless the law specifically says otherwise. 💸

## 4. Using Our Content & Who Owns What
- Listen up: All the awesome original content here is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means no copying, reproducing, or using it for commercial stuff without getting our OK first. Capiche?
- You get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable pass** to check out our content for your personal learning and reading. No sharing your pass, though!
- Wanna use our stuff for commercial reasons or quote a bunch? Hit us up for permission! We're usually pretty cool. 😉

## 5. Playing Nice: User Rules
- Big rule: **Don't upload, publish, or spread** any content that's illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or steps on anyone else's rights. Seriously, don't.
- Also, **no mass downloading, scraping, or trying to crack** our member content with any tech tricks. That's a definite no-go! 🚫
- If you don't play by the rules, we reserve the right to yank that bad content and **boot violating users** right off the platform. 👋

## 6. When Things Change (Or Break)
- FYI: We might change, pause, or even stop some or all of our services anytime, without giving you a heads-up. That's just how it rolls sometimes.
- If our content goes poof for a bit because of things like acts of nature, server oopsies, or third-party hiccups, the Site **won't be on the hook for any compensation**. Bummer, we know, but it happens.

## 7. The Legal Stuff (Disclaimer)
- Just so we're clear: The info we share here is purely for reference. It **doesn't count** as professional advice – like financial, legal, or medical stuff. Always consult a pro for that!
- And look, the Site is **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might face from using our content or services. Just keeping it real.

## 8. Where the Law Steps In
- These Terms of Service are all sorted out under the laws of California, USA. We're talking California law, folks, without getting into any tricky "conflict of law" stuff. 🌴
- Got a beef about these terms? Let's try to chat it out nicely first. If we can't hug it out, then you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. So, see you in Silicon Valley? 😉
