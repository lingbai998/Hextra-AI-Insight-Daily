# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll call "the Site" or "we" from here on out). Before you dive in and start using our awesome services, please do us a solid and carefully read these Terms of Service. By just accessing or using our Site, you're essentially giving us a virtual high-five that you agree to and accept these terms. Cool? Cool.

## 1. Introduction to Services

**Our Services**: The Site offers users paid subscription content and membership services. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Heads up: some content is only for subscribers.

## 2. User Registration and Accounts

- **Users**: To register an account, you'll need a valid email address and a password.
- **Your Account**: You're responsible for its security and all activities. **Seriously, no** transferring or sharing your account!
- **The Site**: We've got the right to **suspend or terminate** your account if you breach these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services

- **Subscription Services**: These are billed on a monthly/annual basis. You'll see the exact fees clearly laid out on the checkout page.
- **Payments**: All payments go through third-party platforms (think Stripe, PayPal 😉). We definitely **don't** store your payment info.
- **Subscriptions**: They'll **auto-renew** unless you cancel 'em before your current billing cycle wraps up.
- **14-Day Refund Policy**: For first-time subscribers, if you're not stoked with the service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why. Each user gets *one shot* at this refund. After 14 days, or for any subsequent subscriptions, payments are **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely says otherwise.

## 4. Content Use and Intellectual Property

- **Original Content**: All the awesome original content? That's **copyrighted by hubtoday**. So, no copying, reposting, or using it for commercial purposes without our say-so.
- **Users**: You only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our stuff, strictly for personal learning and reading.
- **Commercial Use/Bulk Citation**: Wanna use something commercially or cite a bunch? Hit up the Site to get authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines

- **Prohibited Content**: It's a big fat **NO** to uploading, posting, or spreading anything illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or content that infringes on others' rights.
- **Prohibited Technical Actions**: **Absolutely no** bulk downloading, scraping, or trying to crack member content using technical wizardry.
- **The Site**: We've got the right to yank inappropriate content and even **ban users** who break the rules.

## 6. Service Changes and Interruptions

- **The Site**: We totally reserve the right to tweak, suspend, or even axe some or all of our services anytime, without a heads-up.
- **The Site**: If content becomes temporarily unavailable due to force majeure, server glitches, or third-party service interruptions, we're **not on the hook for any compensation**. Bummer, we know.

## 7. Disclaimer

- **Information from the Site**: What we provide is purely for reference. It **doesn't count** as professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff), so don't treat it as such!
- **The Site**: We're **not responsible for anything** – seriously, any direct or indirect losses – that users might incur from using our content or services.

## 8. Governing Law

- **These Terms of Service**: They're governed by and interpreted under the laws of California, USA 🇺🇸, without factoring in any conflict of law principles.
- **Disputes**: Any disagreements stemming from or related to these terms? Let's try to hash them out friendly-style first. If that doesn't work, you agree to take it to the courts with jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California.
