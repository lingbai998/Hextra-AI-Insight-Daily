# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll call "the Site" or "we" from now on). Before you dive into our services, please take a moment to read through these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're giving us the thumbs up and agreeing to these terms.

## 1. Service Overview
**The Site** offers users awesome paid subscription content and member services. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Just a heads-up, some content is only available to our subscribed users. 😉

## 2. User Registration & Your Account
- **Users** need to provide a valid email address and create a password to register for an account. Easy peasy!
- **Users** are totally responsible for keeping their account secure and for all activities that happen under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account. That's a big no-no! 🚫
- If **users** violate these terms, **the Site** reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** their account. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Subscription services** are billed monthly or annually, and the exact fees will be clearly shown on the checkout page. No surprises there!
- All **payments** go through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Don't worry, **the Site** doesn't store any of your payment info. We've got your back! 🔒
- Your **subscription** will **automatically renew** unless you cancel it before the current billing cycle ends. Keep an eye on that calendar!
- **Our 14-Day Refund Policy** is pretty sweet: First-time subscribers, if you're not totally thrilled with our services within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just shoot us an email via the contact info at the end of these terms and tell us why you're leaving. Please note, each user only gets one refund shot. After 14 days, or for non-first-time subscriptions, **no refunds** will be given unless legally required. So choose wisely! 😉

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- All **original content** on **the Site (hubtoday)** is copyrighted by us. Seriously, **no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes** without authorization. That's a big no-no!
- **Users** only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right** to access our content for personal learning and reading. Think of it as your personal library pass! 📚
- If you're looking for commercial use or extensive quoting, please hit us up to get authorization. We're usually pretty cool about it!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Users**, you're **forbidden** from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Let's keep things respectful, folks! 🙏
- Also, **no mass downloading, scraping, or cracking** member-exclusive content using technical means. That's just cheating! 😒
- **The Site** has the right to remove any inappropriate content and **ban users** who break these rules. Play fair!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We** reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. It's just how the tech world rolls!
- If content becomes temporarily unavailable due to unforeseen circumstances like force majeure, server failures, or third-party service outages, **the Site** will **not be liable for any compensation**. Bummer, we know!

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The information** provided by **the Site** is purely for reference. It **does not constitute** any professional advice whatsoever (like financial, legal, or medical advice). So don't take it as gospel!
- **The Site** will **not be responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using our content or services. Just keeping it real!

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. So, California rules! ⚖️
- For any disputes arising from or related to these terms, both parties agree to first try to resolve them through friendly negotiation. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let's hope it doesn't come to that!
