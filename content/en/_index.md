### Frontier Research

1.  The **Tsinghua joint team** has developed a groundbreaking bionic tactile sensor. Dubbed [SuperTac (AI News)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44460-025-00006-y), this innovative sensor draws inspiration 🐦 from pigeon eyeballs. It features multi-spectral imaging that covers an ultra-wideband from ultraviolet to mid-infrared. What's even cooler? It's paired with a dedicated **8.5B-parameter** tactile language model called DOVE. This incredible achievement landed the team on the 🔥 inaugural cover of *Nature Sensors* – a first for a domestic institution as the primary author! Big congrats! 🎉

2.  The **SceneMaker framework** is tackling tough challenges in 3D scene generation head-on. IDEA Research, in collaboration with HKUST, has launched [SceneMaker (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10957), a game-changer that can rocket 🚀 from any image to a complete 3D scene. This bad boy solves the tricky problem of geometric degradation when serious occlusion is involved. Plus, it supports **text-controlled instructions** to de-occlude scenes – how cool is that? The code and data are already [open-source on GitHub (AI News)](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/SceneMaker). Whether you're dealing with indoor or outdoor synthetic images, SceneMaker handles it all! 💪

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  A **17-year-old high school student** has brilliantly used AI to tackle a complex math problem. Enrique, during a simple class break 🎒, managed to solve Erdős Problem #347, even bagging a shout-out from **Terence Tao**! ([Praised by Terence Tao (AI News)](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2026-01-25-4)). He pulled it off using GPT Codex and Aristotle to achieve **Lean formal verification**. Google's Jeff Dean even shared the news, showering him with praise! 🎉 The Erdős Problems website has now officially marked the problem as "**definitely solved**." It's clear: the era of deep integration between human creativity and 🔥 AI computational power is officially here. Get ready! 🚀

2.  **Developers** are still fiercely debating the pros and cons of AI in coding. Some are dead set on [refusing to use AI for coding (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46743095) to uphold professional standards. 🙅‍♂️ On the flip side, another camp sees AI as a powerful tool 💡 for supercharging productivity. A common concern, though, is that newer developers might overuse it, churning out **hard-to-maintain code**. There's also a valid point about the LLM training data loop 🔄 potentially creating an echo chamber. Honestly, the community is starting to feel a bit fatigued by all the extreme AI talk. 😴

### Top Open Source Projects

1.  **Czkawka** is your go-to multi-functional file cleaning tool! This open-source gem, boasting ⭐28.4k stars, is a pro at tackling duplicate files. 💪 But it doesn't stop there – Czkawka can also sniff out empty folders, similar images, and more. It’s a true multi-tool 🔧 for a one-stop solution to all your storage problems. Best part? It’s free and open-source, so dive in! 🤩 Say goodbye to hard drive space anxiety! 💾<br/>

2.  **Supermemory** is busy building the memory engine for the AI era! 🧠 This project, with ⭐14.6k stars, is incredibly fast and scalable. It offers robust memory API services, essentially serving as your AI's second brain. 💡 This open-source project is constantly buzzing with 🔥 hot updates. Get ready to give your AI some serious long-term memory capabilities! ✨<br/>

### Social Media Shares

1.  **Remotion Skills** is getting some serious heat for its subpar performance. A blogger, after [testing it out (AI News)](https://x.com/oran_ge/status/2015384959188607317), declared the layout an absolute mess. 😩 Just goes to show that not everything that's hyped up is actually useful. 🤷‍♀️ We're seeing more and more "AI catfishing" out there. Our advice? Give it a shot yourself before drawing conclusions. 🤔 What you see isn't always the full picture!

2.  **Clawdbot's security risks** are definitely sparking some serious discussion. A blogger [warns (AI News)](https://x.com/op7418/status/2015316726511284627) newbie users ⚠️ to be super cautious with installation. Be aware: linking social media accounts could put you at risk of getting banned. 🚫 And honestly, the documentation is intimidatingly complex. 🤯 Many are understandably hesitant to let it control their primary applications. 💀 Seriously, anyone recommending this should absolutely include a clear security warning. Protect your accounts! 🔒<br/>![AI News: Clawdbot App Security Risk Warning Screenshot](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/01/news_01kftyp62jfq1ba2zgae6e8qdc.avif)<br/>

3.  The **Clawdbot project architecture** is definitely worth a look for developers! Peter Steinberger's [personal assistant project (AI News)](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/2015380647205036131) already supports major communication platforms. If you're interested in Agent architecture ⚙️ and Sandbox implementations, this one's a must-see. The [open-source code (AI News)](https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot) is already out there! However, for regular users, we wouldn't really recommend it right now. 🤔 The stability of AI Agents 🤖 still needs a lot more observation, so proceed with caution. 🚧<br/>![AI News: Clawdbot Project Feature Introduction Interface](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/01/news_01kftyphdae0arj87n8pdhejw6.avif)<br/>
