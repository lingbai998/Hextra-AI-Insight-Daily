### Tracking Tech & Cookies
Cookies and similar tracking tech are what we use to keep tabs on activity on our Service and stash away certain info. The tracking tech we roll with includes beacons, tags, and scripts – all used to gather and follow info, plus level up and analyze our Service. The tech we might be using includes:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies:** A Cookie is just a tiny file chillin' on your Device. You can totally tell your browser to reject all Cookies or give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But heads up, if you don't play ball with Cookies, you might miss out on some parts of our Service. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to say 'no thanks' to Cookies, our Service might just use 'em.
- **Web Beacons:** Some parts of our Service and our emails might have tiny electronic files, known as web beacons (also called clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). These little guys let the Company (for example) count users who have cruised those pages or popped open an email, and they're also used for other related website stats (like tracking how popular a certain section is and checking the integrity of systems and servers).

Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies chill on your personal computer or mobile device even when you go offline, while Session Cookies get the boot the second you close your web browser.

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for these reasons:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type:** Session Cookies
  - **Administered by:** Us
  - **Purpose:** These Cookies are super critical for us to deliver the goods (aka services) available through the Website and let you use some of its cool features. They're all about authenticating users and stopping any shady business with user accounts. Without 'em, the services you're asking for can't happen, and we only use these Cookies to hook you up with those services.

- **Cookies Policy / Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type:** Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by:** Us
  - **Purpose:** These Cookies are all about figuring out if users have given the green light to the use of cookies on the Website.

The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized experience and save you the hassle of re-entering your preferences every single time you hit up the Website.

For more deets on the Cookies we use and your options concerning them, just swing by our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section of our Privacy Policy.

### Keeping Your Personal Data on Hand
The Company will only keep Your Personal Data for as long as it's needed for the purposes laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll hold onto and use Your Personal Data as much as we need to for following our legal obligations (like if we gotta keep your data to play by the applicable laws), sorting out beefs, and enforcing our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also keep Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data is usually kept for a shorter run, unless that data is used to beef up the security of our Service or level up its functionality, or if we're legally obligated to stash that data away for a longer period.

### Passing Along Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means your info might get transferred to – and chilling on – computers outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where data protection laws might be different from yours.

Your nod to this Privacy Policy and dropping off such info means you're totally okay with that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure Your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't pass Your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are solid controls in place (including the security of Your data and other personal info).

### Ditching Your Personal Data
You've got the right to ditch or ask us to help you ditch the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might even let you wipe out certain info about yourself right from inside the Service.

You can totally log into Your Account (if you've got one) any time and hit up the account settings section that lets you manage Your personal info to update, tweak, or delete your info. You can also give us a shout to request access to, correct, or delete any Personal Data you've handed over to us.

But heads up, we might need to hang onto certain info when we've got a legal obligation or a legit reason to do so.

### Spilling the Beans on Your Personal Data

#### Business Deals
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, Your Personal Data might just get shuffled around. We'll give you a heads-up before Your Personal Data gets transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
In certain sitches, the Company might be asked to spill Your Personal Data if the law demands it or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or government agency).

#### Other Legal Stuff
The Company might spill Your Personal Data if it genuinely believes that such action is necessary to:
- Play by the legal rules
- Protect and defend the Company's rights or property
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
- Stay clear of legal liability

### Keeping Your Personal Data Safe & Sound
The security of Your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but let's be real: no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% bulletproof. While we hustle to use commercially acceptable ways to shield Your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Privacy for the Little Ones
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't intentionally scoop up personal identifying info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kid has handed over Personal Data to us, please give us a shout. If we find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we'll take steps to wipe that info from our servers.

If we need to lean on consent as the legal basis for processing Your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might just ask for your parents' nod before we scoop up and use that info.

## Links to Other Cool Sites
Our Service might pack in links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll get zapped straight to that third party's site. We totally recommend you peep the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We've got zero control over the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services, and we're not taking any responsibility for 'em.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might tweak our Privacy Policy from time to time. We'll give you a heads-up about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before the changes go live, we'll let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

We recommend you give this Privacy Policy a regular once-over for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they're posted on this page.
